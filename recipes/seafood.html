    <p>Some people add carrots, potatoes and other vegetables to the stew, but I stuck to some simple celery and a bell
        pepper for mine. Also, if you have caraway seeds you can add some crushed, but I didn’t have any at home so I
        substitued with cumin instead.</p>
    <p>Goulash is traditionally served over small egg noodles or in other parts of the world over mashed potatoes or
        polenta.
        Ive always eaten this flavorful stew over rice…but not just any rice…Uncle Ben’s Rice. But however you choose to
        eat
        it…its a dish youll love for sure.</p>
